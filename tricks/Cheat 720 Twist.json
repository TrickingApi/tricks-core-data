There is some debate whether \u201craiz twist\u201d and \u201ccheat 7 twist\u201d are the same thing, but if they differ, they differ in shape and timing, but the axis is relatively the same. Originally created by \u201ccheating\u201d a Double Butterly Twist. Despite its name, this move has no relation to the Cheat 720 kick."}
